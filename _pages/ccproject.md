# How I Turned a Failing Contact Center Project Around in 6 Weeks

## Opening

When I joined the project, the situation was tense. The customer had lost confidence in the solution — they were adamant it didn’t meet their requirements. The Cisco Partner managing the implementation was struggling to keep up, largely because the customer’s needs kept evolving, sometimes weekly.

The project was months behind schedule, trust was eroding fast, and the risk of cancellation was real. What made it worse: no one could agree on what “done” looked like.

That’s when I was asked to step in.

## Background

The implementation was being handled by a newly certified Cisco UCCE Authorized Technology Provider (ATP). While the partner had solid experience working with other vendors, this was their first on-premises UCCE deployment — and the complexity quickly became overwhelming.

The client, a major telecommunications company operating across several European countries, had high expectations. Their contact center was mission-critical, and the project involved intricate routing logic, third-party integrations, and strict compliance requirements.

The partner wasn’t prepared for how rapidly the client’s needs evolved, and without deep UCCE experience, they struggled to adapt. Miscommunication, unclear ownership, and a growing backlog of unresolved issues put the project at risk of total failure.

That’s when I stepped in to bridge the gap between the client’s business needs and the partner’s technical delivery.

## The Turning Point

The first thing I did was go back to the beginning.

I started by systematically collecting all known issues — not just technical bugs, but also process gaps, miscommunications, and missed expectations. In a project like this, you can't fix what you don't fully understand, and I knew that getting clarity would take time and patience.

The most difficult part wasn’t solving the problems — it was identifying where the core issues actually were.

Was it a lack of Cisco UCCE expertise on the partner's side? Miscommunication between the partner and the client? Or had the original project scope failed to account for how quickly the client's requirements would evolve?

It turned out to be a mix of all three.

Understanding that gave me the foundation I needed to start building a path forward — one rooted in transparency, structure, and clear ownership.

## The Strategy

In the first week, we focused on resetting expectations.

We brought the delivery team and the client together and aligned on what was realistic, what was missing, and what "success" would actually look like. For each requirement, we defined clear success criteria — no more vague goals or open-ended tasks.

Just as importantly, for the requirements that could not be delivered as originally requested, we didn’t just say “no.” Instead, we took the time to explain Cisco’s recommended approach and offered technically sound, future-proof alternatives that met the client’s business intent — even if the implementation details looked different than they had imagined.

This shift in approach changed the dynamic. We moved from conflict to collaboration, from blame to solution design.

## Execution: Driving Change Week by Week

With expectations aligned and success criteria clearly defined, we shifted into focused execution.

A major part of our strategy was to rebuild trust through better customer experience — not just for the end users calling in, but also for the agents handling those interactions. To achieve that, we introduced automation and smarter integrations that immediately improved service flow and agent productivity.

One of the most impactful changes was the integration of the IVR with the client’s CRM system. This allowed us to surface a caller card to the agent before the call was even answered — showing key customer information like account status, recent activity, and open tickets.

This not only reduced average handling time but also gave agents more context and confidence, ultimately improving first call resolution and customer satisfaction.

Each week had a focus:
- **Week 1**: Align on expectations, define success criteria.
- **Week 2**: Validate IVR call flows, clean up queue configuration.
- **Week 3**: CRM integration and caller card implementation.
- **Week 4**: Agent workflow optimization and training refresh.
- **Week 5**: Monitoring and reporting improvements.
- **Week 6**: Final testing, documentation, and sign-off.

## The Results

By the end of the sixth week, we had achieved what many thought was no longer possible:  
✔️ The solution was signed off by the customer  
✔️ All key requirements were either delivered or successfully re-scoped with mutual agreement  
✔️ Customer satisfaction was restored — not just with the solution, but with the delivery process

The project was formally closed as a success, and more importantly, it opened the door to new opportunities:
- The customer initiated follow-up projects with the same Cisco Partner
- The delivery team gained confidence and a repeatable approach for future UCCE implementations
- Trust between all parties — customer, partner, and Cisco — was restored

## Lessons Learned

- **Expectation management is everything**: Clear success criteria upfront changes the entire conversation.
- **You don’t need to say “no” — offer a better “yes”**: Explaining the reasoning behind Cisco’s architecture builds long-term trust.
- **Automation + Integration = Real CX impact**: The caller card and CRM-linked IVR weren’t just technical wins — they made a visible difference to agents and customers.
- **Listening before fixing**: Taking the time to fully understand the problem space upfront saved weeks of rework later.
