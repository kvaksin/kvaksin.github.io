## ☁️ Your On-Premises Contact Center Solution Is Reaching End of Life (EoL) – What’s Next?

As your current on-premises Contact Center platform approaches its End of Life (EoL), it’s time to evaluate your next move.

There are several paths forward:

1. 🔄 **Migrate to a new Contact Center vendor**  
2. ☁️ **Move to the cloud**

### Why Cloud?

Cloud is an attractive option—but **which one** should you choose?

## 🧠 Think Strategically Before You Move

Migration is a **complex and costly** process. Before you decide, ask yourself:

1. 🔐 **Are security and GDPR concerns more critical than the benefits of moving to a modern platform** that ensures long-term sustainability?
2. 👨‍💻 **Would you rather invest in training your engineers to maintain legacy systems**, or benefit from simplified operations with CCaaS?
3. 🧱 **Are you clinging to legacy functionality out of habit**, even though the market has moved on?
4. 💰 **Where should your investments go—OPEX or CAPEX?**
5. 🔀 **Would a hybrid model suit you better**, keeping PII data inside your enterprise while letting a trusted vendor handle everything else?
