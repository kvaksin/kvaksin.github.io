# 🤖 AI and the Contact Center: Closing the Gap

A new era of AI is here — and it’s impossible to sit back and wait. The question is: **how far is your solution from reality?**

If you’re lucky enough to have already migrated to a **CCaaS (Contact Center as a Service)** platform, you might proudly say:

> “Yes, we’re using AI. We’ve got bots, call analysis, AI-powered WFO, and tons of features out of the box.”

But what if you’re still running an **on-premise contact center**, where calls are recorded and stored internally, and strict security policies are in place?

Does that mean you’re stuck — forever behind?

Well… yes and no.

Yes, you will **always be behind** if you rely solely on static, open-source models that are outdated the moment you install them.

But **no**, you’re not completely stuck. You can build your own solution — and it doesn’t have to be rocket science.

## 🎧 Transcribe & Analyze Calls with Your Own LLM

Even with internal storage and strict policies, you can still **process recorded calls** using modern AI models — including transcription and analysis.

Check out [Whisper by OpenAI](https://github.com/openai/whisper), a powerful open-source speech recognition model you can run locally.

## ✅ Application Design: Call Processing & CRM Update

Here’s how a complete solution might look:

This is a **high-level solution** — and it's **not rocket science**. What would you need to add?  
Just some **graphs**, a **UI**, and a bit of **intelligence** to find out the **sentiment of the call**.  
Lots of fun will come when the business starts realizing just **how far you can go**.

### 3. 🔁 Workflow Steps

#### 🛎 Step 1: Notification from Call Recording System
- Use **webhooks** or polling to detect when a call ends and a recording is available.

```json
{
  "call_id": "abc123",
  "recording_url": "https://example.com/recording/abc123.mp3"
}
```

#### ⬇ Step 2: Download the Recording
- Download the audio file via the provided URL.
- Store it temporarily (e.g., on disk or in an S3 bucket).

#### 🧠 Step 3: Transcription (Whisper)
- Use Whisper to transcribe MP3/WAV audio into text.

#### 📝 Step 4: Summarization & Topic Detection
- Use a local or cloud LLM to:
  - Generate a **summary** (bulleted or paragraph form)
  - Extract the **main topic**, e.g., "Sales Inquiry" or "Support Request"

#### 📤 Step 5: Send to CRM
- Send a POST request to your CRM with the results:

```json
{
  "call_id": "abc123",
  "transcript": "...",
  "summary": "...",
  "topic": "Customer Support",
  "duration": "8m12s"
}
```
