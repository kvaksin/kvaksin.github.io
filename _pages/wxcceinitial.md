# Understanding Webex Contact Center Enterprise (WxCCE): Customers and Connectivity

---

## What is WxCCE?

Webex Contact Center Enterprise (WxCCE) is Cisco’s cloud-hosted contact center solution designed for large enterprises with complex customer engagement needs. It delivers scalable, secure, and highly customizable omnichannel experiences, combining the power of Cisco’s proven contact center technology with the flexibility of cloud deployment.

## Who is the Customer for WxCCE?

WxCCE’s customer ecosystem can be understood in three layers:

1. **Enterprise End-Customers:**  
   Large organizations across industries like finance, healthcare, retail, telecommunications, and government use WxCCE to deliver seamless customer service. They require multichannel support, advanced routing, CRM integrations, and analytics at scale.

2. **Cisco (Infrastructure Provider):**  
   Cisco hosts, operates, and maintains the WxCCE platform in secure cloud data centers. Cisco ensures the platform’s reliability, security, and feature updates.

3. **Cisco Partners:**  
   While WxCCE is Cisco-hosted, Cisco partners play a key role in selling, consulting, and integrating WxCCE with enterprise systems, helping customers adopt and optimize the solution.

## How Enterprises Connect to the Cisco-Hosted WxCCE Cloud

Because WxCCE is a **Cisco-hosted cloud service**, enterprises must establish secure and reliable network connectivity between their on-premises infrastructure and Cisco’s cloud. There is no partner-hosted deployment option.

### Connectivity Options:

- **IPSec VPN Tunnels:**  
  Secure encrypted tunnels over the internet, providing flexible and relatively easy connections for signaling and media.

- **Private WAN / MPLS Connections:**  
  Dedicated private network links that offer low latency, high reliability, and consistent performance.

- **Cisco Webex Edge Connect:**  
  A Cisco-managed service delivering private, optimized connectivity designed specifically for Webex applications, enhancing performance and reliability.

---

### Telephony Integration:

- Enterprises typically use **Bring Your Own PSTN (BYoPSTN)**, connecting their existing telephony providers to WxCCE via Cisco Unified Border Element (CUBE) appliances.

---

### Reliability and Security:

- Redundant connectivity paths and strict security policies ensure high availability and data protection.

---

## Why Choose WxCCE?

- **Scalability:** Cloud infrastructure supports growing business needs without the overhead of on-premises hardware.
- **Omnichannel Engagement:** Support for voice, chat, email, SMS, and social channels in a unified platform.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Real-time insights and historical data for better decision-making.
