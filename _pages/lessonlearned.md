# 5 Lessons I Learned from Working at Cisco

Working at Cisco was more than just a job—it was an opportunity to be part of a global leader in technology and to learn from some of the most talented professionals in the industry. My time there shaped how I approach challenges, collaboration, and innovation. Here are five key lessons I took away from the experience.

## 1. The Power of Collaboration
Cisco thrives on teamwork. With teams spread across geographies, I learned the importance of clear communication, trust, and cultural awareness. Collaboration wasn’t just a buzzword—it was the foundation for delivering solutions that scaled globally.

## 2. Innovation Is a Continuous Process
Cisco encouraged constant learning and experimenting. I discovered that innovation doesn’t always mean creating something entirely new; sometimes it’s about improving what already exists or applying it in a smarter way. Staying curious and adaptable proved essential.

## 3. Customer-Centric Thinking Drives Success
Every product, service, and decision ultimately ties back to customer needs. At Cisco, I learned to put myself in the customer’s shoes, understanding their pain points and designing solutions that solved real-world problems.

## 4. Leadership Exists at Every Level
You don’t need a management title to be a leader. Cisco taught me that leadership is about taking ownership, mentoring peers, and setting an example through accountability and integrity. I had the opportunity to demonstrate this in **pre-sales activities**—leading technical discussions, presenting solutions to clients, and guiding them through decision-making. These experiences strengthened my ability to influence without authority and build trust with both colleagues and customers.

## 5. Building Your Network Is Key
One of the most important lessons I had to learn was the value of actively building a professional network. At Cisco, I realized that strong connections open doors to new opportunities, accelerate problem-solving, and provide access to diverse perspectives. Cultivating relationships internally and externally became an essential part of my professional growth.
