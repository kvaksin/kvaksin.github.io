# Simplifying School-Parent Meeting Scheduling

Recently, our family faced a small but common challenge. My daughterâ€™s school announced quarterly meetings with professors through a WhatsApp parent chat. The message was sent only once â€” about a month before the actual event. As a result, many parents, including us, missed the meeting simply because we lost track of the announcement.

This experience highlighted how fragile informal communication channels can be when it comes to organizing important school events.

## The Problem

- Meeting details shared once in a group chat  
- No reminders or calendar integration  
- High chance of missing important appointments  

While this might seem minor, effective communication between parents and teachers is essential for student progress. Relying solely on chat messages wasnâ€™t enough.

## The Solution

To make the process easier for everyone, I decided to build a simple **online booking tool** that allows parents to view and reserve meeting slots directly in a shared calendar.

ðŸ‘‰ **App:** [rdvapp-vlk0.onrender.com](https://rdvapp-vlk0.onrender.com/)  
ðŸ“˜ **GitHub README:** [github.com/kvaksin/rdvapp](https://github.com/kvaksin/rdvapp/blob/main/README.md)

### Key Features
- Fast meeting booking interface  
- Calendar view with time-slot management  
- Automatic synchronization of meeting details  
- No dependency on chat messages or reminders  

## Development Journey

This small project became an opportunity to strengthen my **full-stack development skills**.  
I built the application using modern technologies for both the front and back ends, focusing on clarity, reliability, and ease of use.

**Stack Highlights:**
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express  
- **Database:** MongoDB  
- **Deployment:** Render  
- **AI assistance:** used AI tools for prototyping, code review, and optimizing backend logic  

Through this project, I gained full-cycle experience â€” from concept to production â€” and can now confidently call myself a **full-stack developer**.

## README Summary

The [README](https://github.com/kvaksin/rdvapp/blob/main/README.md) provides a detailed overview of the system architecture, setup instructions, and core design principles.  
It outlines:
- How the app handles user sessions and booking validation  
- Deployment steps for Render  
- Planned improvements like email notifications and multi-user support  

Itâ€™s written as both a **technical reference** and a **personal learning log**, showing how a small family need evolved into a working web application.

## Results and Takeaways

Within a few days of introducing the tool, parents found it much easier to confirm their appointments and avoid confusion. It demonstrated how a lightweight, practical digital solution can significantly improve communication between schools and families.

Even small, real-world problems can inspire useful applications â€” and sometimes, solving them is the best way to grow new skills.
