# 🤖 AI and the On-Premise Contact Center: Closing the Gap

A new era of AI is here — and it’s impossible to sit back and wait. The question is: **how far is your solution from reality?**

If you’re lucky enough to have already migrated to a **CCaaS (Contact Center as a Service)** platform, you might proudly say:

> “Yes, we’re using AI. We’ve got bots, call analysis, AI-powered WFO, and tons of features out of the box.”

But what if you’re still running an **on-premise contact center**, where calls are recorded and stored internally, and strict security policies are in place?

Does that mean you’re stuck — forever behind?

Well… yes and no.

Yes, you will **always be behind** if you rely solely on static, open-source models that are outdated the moment you install them.

But **no**, you're not entirely stuck. You can build your own solution — and it doesn’t require rocket science.



## 🎧 Transcribe & Analyze Calls with Your Own LLM

Even with internal storage and strict policies, you can still **process recorded calls** using modern AI models — including transcription and analysis.

Check out [Whisper by OpenAI](https://github.com/openai/whisper), a powerful open-source speech recognition model you can run locally.

## ✅ Application Design: Call Processing, Translation & CRM Update

Here’s how a full AI pipeline can be implemented on-premise:

### 1. 📦 Components Overview

| Component | Role |
|----|----|
| **Call Recording Service** | Notifies your app when a call is finished and a recording is ready |
| **App Backend (Flask)** | Receives notifications, downloads recordings, runs processing pipeline |
| **Whisper LLM** | Transcribes audio to text & detects language |
| **Ollama (Local LLM)** | Summarizes, translates, detects topic & emotional tone |
| **CRM API Client** | Sends the final output to your CRM system |

### 2. 🏗 Enhanced High-Level Architecture

        Whisper Transcriber ──► Transcript (auto language detect)
              │
              ▼
     LLM Module (Summary, Topic, Translation, Emotion)
              │
              ▼
         CRM Integration Service ──► Send structured data to CRM
```

### 3. 🔁 Workflow Steps (with Multilingual & Emotion Support)

#### 🛎 Step 1: Webhook Triggered

```json
{
"call_id":"abc123",
"recording_url":"https://example.com/recordings/abc123.mp3"
}
```

#### ⬇ Step 2: Download the Audio

* Save the file as `downloads/abc123.mp3`

#### 🧠 Step 3: Transcription & Language Detection

* Whisper automatically detects the language and returns plain text transcription.

#### 📚 Step 4: Summarize, Translate & Analyze
Use a local LLM (e.g. via Ollama) to:

Summarize the transcript

Detect topic and emotional tone

Translate if the language isn’t English

#### 📤 Step 5: Send to CRM

```json
{
"call_id":"abc123",
"language":"es",
"transcript":"Hola, tengo un problema con mi factura...",
"translated_transcript":"Hello, I have a problem with my invoice...",
"summary":["Customer is confused about a bill.","Asked for a refund."],
"topic":"Billing Issue",
"sentiment":"Negative",
"emotion":"Frustrated",
"timestamp":"2025-07-13T14:22:00Z"
}
```


## 🧾 Sample Implementation with Multilingual & Emotional Analysis

```python

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import requests
import whisper
import json
import os
from datetime import datetime

app = Flask(__name__)
model = whisper.load_model("base")

CRM_ENDPOINT = "https://your-crm.example.com/api/calls"
OLLAMA_URL = "http://localhost:11434/api/generate"
LLM_MODEL = "llama3"
os.makedirs("downloads", exist_ok=True)

def download_audio(url, call_id):
    path = f"downloads/{call_id}.mp3"
    r = requests.get(url)
    with open(path, "wb") as f:
        f.write(r.content)
    return path

prompt = f"""
You are an AI contact center assistant. Analyze the call transcript below.

Transcript:{transcript}

Return JSON with:
- summary: 3 bullet points
- topic: short category (e.g. Billing, Tech Support)
- sentiment: Positive / Neutral / Negative
- emotion: main emotion (e.g. Frustrated, Calm, Angry)
- translated_transcript: translate to English if not already

Language: {language}
