# 🤖 AI and the On-Premise Contact Center: Closing the Gap

A new era of AI is here — and it’s impossible to sit back and wait. The question is: **how far is your solution from reality?**

If you’re lucky enough to have already migrated to a **CCaaS (Contact Center as a Service)** platform, you might proudly say:

> “Yes, we’re using AI. We’ve got bots, call analysis, AI-powered WFO, and tons of features out of the box.”

But what if you’re still running an **on-premise contact center**, where calls are recorded and stored internally, and strict security policies are in place?

Does that mean you’re stuck — forever behind?

Well… yes and no.

Yes, you will **always be behind** if you rely solely on static, open-source models that are outdated the moment you install them.

But **no**, you’re not completely stuck. You can build your own solution — and it doesn’t have to be rocket science.

## 🎧 Transcribe & Analyze Calls with Your Own LLM

Even with internal storage and strict policies, you can still **process recorded calls** using modern AI models — including transcription and analysis.

Check out [Whisper by OpenAI](https://github.com/openai/whisper), a powerful open-source speech recognition model you can run locally.

## ✅ Application Design: Call Processing, Translation & CRM Update

Here’s how a full AI pipeline can be implemented on-premise:

### 1. 📦 Components Overview

| Component              | Role                                                                 |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Call Recording Service** | Notifies your app when a call is finished and a recording is ready |
| **App Backend (Flask)**     | Receives notifications, downloads recordings, runs processing pipeline |
| **Whisper LLM**            | Transcribes audio to text & detects language                      |
| **Ollama (Local LLM)**     | Summarizes, translates, detects topic & emotional tone            |
| **CRM API Client**         | Sends the final output to your CRM system                          |

### 2. 🏗 Enhanced High-Level Architecture

        Whisper Transcriber ──► Transcript (auto language detect)
              │
              ▼
     LLM Module (Summary, Topic, Translation, Emotion)
              │
              ▼
         CRM Integration Service ──► Send structured data to CRM
```

### 3. 🔁 Workflow Steps (with Multilingual & Emotion Support)

#### 🛎 Step 1: Webhook Triggered

```json
{
  "call_id": "abc123",
  "recording_url": "https://example.com/recordings/abc123.mp3"
}
```

#### ⬇ Step 2: Download the Audio

- Save the file to `downloads/abc123.mp3`

#### 🧠 Step 3: Transcription & Language Detection

- Whisper automatically identifies language and returns plain text.

#### 🧠 Step 4: LLM Analysis (Ollama)

- Generate:
  - ✅ Summary (bulleted)
  - ✅ Topic (classification)
  - ✅ Sentiment (Positive / Neutral / Negative)
  - ✅ Emotional tone (e.g. Frustrated, Calm, Confused)
  - ✅ English translation (if original not in English)

#### 📤 Step 5: Send to CRM

```json
{
  "call_id": "abc123",
  "language": "es",
  "transcript": "Hola, tengo un problema con mi factura...",
  "translated_transcript": "Hello, I have a problem with my invoice...",
  "summary": ["Customer is confused about a bill.", "Asked for a refund."],
  "topic": "Billing Issue",
  "sentiment": "Negative",
  "emotion": "Frustrated",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-13T14:22:00Z"
}
```

### 4. 🔐 Security & Reliability

- ✅ HMAC-secured webhook  
- 🔁 Retry logic (downloads, CRM)  
- 🔐 Encrypted at rest & in transit  
- ⚙️ Async workers / message queue  
- 📈 Logs + audit trail
